# Multi-Vendor Marketplace

## Project Overview
This project is a scalable, loosely-coupled Multi-Vendor Marketplace built using microservices architecture. It allows multiple vendors to list their products, manage orders, and handle payments. The marketplace includes features such as personalized recommendations, real-time notifications, and seamless scalability using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Architecture
The marketplace is divided into several microservices, each responsible for a specific domain:

1. **User Service**: Handles user registration, login, profile management, and vendor management with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
2. **Product Service**: Manages product listings, search, category management, stock tracking, and image uploads.
3. **Order Service**: Responsible for order creation, status updates, cart management, and integration with payment and notification services.
4. **Payment Service**: Processes secure payments using platforms like Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal, and manages order confirmations and refunds.
5. **Recommendation Service**: Provides personalized product recommendations using machine learning models based on user behavior.
6. **Notification Service**: Sends real-time notifications for order updates, promotions, and user messages using WebSockets or Kafka.
7. **API Gateway**: Centralizes request routing, authentication, and load balancing, with features like rate limiting and logging.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express.js, NestJS, or Fastify)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth, or OpenID
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Minikube or EKS/GKE)
- **API Gateway**: Nginx, Kong, or Express.js
- **Message Queue**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Redis
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd multi-vendor-marketplace
   ```

2. **Docker Setup**: 
   - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
   - Run the following command to start all services:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Kubernetes Setup**: 
   - Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster running (Minikube, EKS, or GKE).
   - Apply the Kubernetes configurations:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

4. **Access the Application**: 
   - The application can be accessed via the API Gateway endpoint.
